# HR-Insights
Hello Users, this is my first data analytics project on the company's HR dataset containing of the employee attendance.
Based on it, I'v created an interactive dashboard with the help of PowerBi to understand the trends observed from the data.
It showcases the presence of the number of employees in a particular month, sick leaves taken, and WFH preference using DAX functions and dashboard creation.
Performing careful analytics by deriving important metrics used to report the most preferred working day attendance alongside the days mostly for leaves.
This helps the HR to understand and plan based on the insights to prioritise the days for group building activities, managing office space and carrying out important renovation duties if needed in the workspace.
